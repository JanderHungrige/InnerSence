Hi Jan,

 

Please find attached. It took me one hour to figure out that you need to downsample the resp signal to 10 Hz before using the algorithm.

 

I have also attached the resp peak settings that you need to load for adjusting peak setection.

 

I had to modify it for use in BCG but I give you the original one. you might need to adjust it for chest impedance.

 

Reagrds,
