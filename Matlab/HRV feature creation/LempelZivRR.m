% RR: 5min RR distance data
% Neonate: Which patient
% saving: If saving is whished
% savefolder: Where to save
% win: Duration of the HRV window. Comon is 5min/300s

% One way to do it would be to take the Hilbert transform (matlab function 'hilbert'),
% of the timeseries data to get the analytic signal. 
% Taking the absolute value of this (matlab function 'abs'), 
% you get a new set of time series indicating the amplitude of the signal
% at each timepoint. You can binarize the data by thresholding this this time series.
% Schartner et al 2015-2016 suggest using the mean of the signal amplitude as a
% threshold. ref: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133532

%   The type of complexity to evaluate as a string, which is one of:
%       - 'exhaustive': complexity measurement is based on decomposing S 
%       into an exhaustive production process.
%       - 'primitive': complexity measurement is based on decomposing S 
%       into a primitive production process.
%   Exhaustive complexity can be considered a lower limit of the complexity
%   measurement approach proposed in LZ76, and primitive complexity an
%   upper limit.
%
%   normalize:
%   A logical value (true or false), used to specify whether or not the 
%   complexity value returned is normalized or not.  
%   Where normalization is applied, the normalized complexity is 
%   calculated from the un-normalized complexity, C_raw, as:
%       C = C_raw / (n / log2(n))
%   where n is the length of the sequence S.
